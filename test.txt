Create a new project in the Google Developer Console:

Go to the Google Developer Console and create a new project if you haven't already.
Configure the OAuth consent screen:

In the left sidebar, navigate to "OAuth consent screen."
Choose the user type and enter the required details like the application name and authorized domains.
Create OAuth client ID:

After setting up the consent screen, go to the "Credentials" tab in the left sidebar.
Click on the "Create credentials" button and select "OAuth client ID."
Choose the application type (web application in this case) and enter the necessary details.
Add the authorized redirect URI (if applicable).
Retrieve the Client ID: 1059100419316-m0qvdfmbqg1egkhm9v2a3fkt8tu3un68.apps.googleusercontent.com
secret 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

Once the OAuth client ID is created, you'll see the client ID listed in the credentials section. It will look something like this: 1234567890-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890.apps.googleusercontent.com.
Copy this Client ID and replace 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID' in your code with the actual Client ID.
